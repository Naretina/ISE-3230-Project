A school is hosting a one-week summer reading workshop and has given parents the flexibility to choose several hours that they would be able to bring their child/children to attend one of those hours. Only children who are either in middle school or upper elementary may attend, and these grade groups will be separated. Each grade group has three instructors that can only host one class at a time for the given one-hour classes. However, a middle school session and upper elementary session can run concurrently, but there cannot be two upper elementary sessions or two middle school sessions at once. The instructors would like between 10 to 20 students each session (so that one class isn't too much larger than another at a different time). The school wants to find the lowest number of classes they can hold given 60 students who have been signed up.

No data for this kind of problem exists online, so we will have to construct a dummy dataset based on this scenario. The dummy dataset would consist of variables such as an arbitrary ID given to a student, a student's first and last name, gender, age, and the times available. (All names given will be generated using https://www.behindthename.com/random/) Data would be parsed later into useful information.
